# watermark-app

This is a watermark-your-image app that uses a Tkinter GUI.

Functionality includes the following: the choice of watermarking with another image, or with text; the choice of text color if you do choose to watermark with text;
and placement of the watermark's location on the base image.

You'll be asked to upload your base image, choose and upload your watermark settings, and then your watermarked image will be saved as "watermarked_image.png" in the current
directory.

Enjoy! And please do let me know if you have any comments, constructive criticism, and/or bug reports.
